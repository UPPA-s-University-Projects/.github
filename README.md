# University projects - Bachelor degree - Promotion 2019/2022

Welcome to this organization! It will store every source code for projects made during the three years bachelor degree at UPPA (Université de Pau et des Pays de l'Adour).

## Repo naming convention

> [bachelor-level(year)-year-course-project_name]
> ex : 3-2021-mobile1-final

What does that mean? This repo contains :
| Key                   | Value          |
|-----------------------|----------------|
| Bachelor level (year) | 3 (third year) |
| Year                  | 2021           |
| Course name           | Mobile 1       |
| Project name          | final          |

So **what does it mean?** This exemple repo contains the code for the course *Mobile 1*, see during the *third year* (3) (*2021*), and contains *the final project* (this project contains lessons code i.e activity).
If any repo finish by ***cours***, then it contains code see throughought the course during lessons.

<!-- ## About l'Université de Pau et des Pays de l'Adour
L'université de Pau et des Pays de l'Adour is a large chain of university throughout the south west of France. I've studied at the
[College of Sciences and Technology for Energy and Environment](College of Sciences and Technology for Energy and Environment).
Speciliazed in sciences in the domain of energies and environment (energies for the environment).

### About the bachelor degree

#### First year
The first year was linked to the college name, we taught basic principle of programming, computer architecture and got some biology / ethologie courses to add context to our projects.
We didn't learn much during this first year only C, swift, HTML, CSS and how to make UML models.
The biggest project was an iOS app, an excel macro (to order and clean data, project made in collaboration with a PhD student, which was cool because we knew the project would really help and wasn't just a simple *school problem*).
Near the end of the year (which ends in april/may for first year students),we started learning OOP, and COVID-19 hit the world.

#### Second year
The second year was followed from home due to COVID-19. Because France decided to apply great measure to contain COVID-19 infections we were asked to follow courses from home starting October/November all the way to the end of the year in march/april/may.
We got more into OOP, having a first real course about introduction to this concept. Our bachelor uses Java for nearly all projects (except some projects in swift, web and one special you can find over the [Stonks Life Inc. organization](https://github.com/Stonks-Life-Inc/university-sailfish-suivisante-app).)

>Note: I won't enter into too much detail in this README, but at the end of the year we went really advanced inside the world of computer science (compared to other cursus in France).
We didn't know much about real project making nor real project in general (as our projects consisted of easy one).

Also, they decided to forget about the biology side and 

#### Third year
The third year, they went beserk. We went back to the university, no more at home courses. We were introduced to logistics, which became the center of our courses. Everything was related to logistics now. -->
