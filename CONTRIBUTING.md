### I don't want to read this whole thing I just have a question!!!

**To make it simple :**

#### 1. Asking questions and discussions

>⚠Note: Please don't file an issue to ask a question!

If you have a question, start a new discussion (after searching for a related discussion). Discussion are the place to ask question and interact with the community by default!


#### 2. Issues

>⚠Note: You should open an issue if you are sure about it (if not, open a new discussion first). Respect rule #1

Issues should be open before making a PR. They are a place to discuss about:
* feature requests
* bug report
* documentation enhancement
* security issue

Templates have been made to make your life easier. However you can make your own structure **as long as it's easy to read and display every important information for the type of issue you are opening.


#### 3. Pull Requests

>⚠Note: This is your final step when contributing. Before creating a PR you should have followed rule #1 and #2 (even though rule #1 is not always necessary).

Pull Request is the last step in contributing to the project. A template has been made to make your life easier, bt you can write your own structure as long as it's easy to read and understand and display all the relevent information we need to accept your PR.

>**⚠IMPORTANT NOTE: Any contribution is appreciated! From newcomers to experimented open source developer, any contribution (from discussion to PR) should be welcomed and friendly for anyone!
>Any hostility because ***you are superior and the other person propose a dumb idea*** is prohebited. If you are newcomer, don't be afraid to propose idea, open issue and even make Pull request.
>If you are an experimented developer you should remeber when you first started. Anyone can propose ideas!**

Thank you very much to anyone contributing and anyone making Open Source and this project a nice and friendly place for anyone!
